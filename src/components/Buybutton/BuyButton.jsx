  Being able to provide lifesaving medical treatment to hundreds of stray cats every year is incredibly rewarding for us, but also costly. We couldnâ€™t do it without the support we receive from our friends, family and donors.

Your donation would go towards:
Sterilization or spay/neuter of stray cats
Inpatient care for critically sick or injured cats
Emergency surgeries such as amputations/dental extractions
Special diets for ill or underweight cats
